# Installation Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for installing the Recursive Self-Observing Intelligence Framework.

## Prerequisites

The framework requires Python 3.8 or higher and depends on the following libraries:

- NumPy (1.20+)
- SciPy (1.7+)
- Matplotlib (3.5+)

## Option 1: Installing from GitHub

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Recursive-Self-Observing-Intelligence-Framework.git
cd Recursive-Self-Observing-Intelligence-Framework
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Option 2: Installing as a Package

When the package is available on PyPI, you can install it directly:

```bash
pip install recursive-intelligence
```

## Verifying Installation

To verify your installation, run the included test suite:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

Or run the demonstration script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Installation for Development

If you're planning to contribute to the development, we recommend setting up a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter errors about missing modules, ensure you've installed all dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **NumPy/SciPy Version Conflicts**: If you experience issues with NumPy or SciPy versions:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy==1.22.0 scipy==1.8.0
   ```

3. **Matplotlib Display Issues**: If visualization doesn't work:
   ```bash
   # For Linux users who might be missing tkinter:
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```

### Getting Help

2. Open a new issue with a detailed description of your problem and environment

## System Requirements

- **Minimum**: 2GB RAM, dual-core processor
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM, quad-core processor for larger datasets and deeper recursive depths
- **Storage**: 100MB for the framework and examples
