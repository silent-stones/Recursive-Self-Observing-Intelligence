# Recursive Self-Observing Intelligence Framework

Quantum-inspired intelligence framework that uses recursive self-observation to achieve coherent knowledge representation and processing.

## Overview

This framework implements a novel approach to artificial intelligence based on quantum-inspired principles:

- **Phase-Space Representation**: Information is stored in continuous phase space rather than discrete states
- **Multi-Scale Entanglement**: Hierarchical entanglement structure enables cross-scale information alignment
- **Recursive Self-Observation**: The system observes and optimizes its own information processes
- **Adaptive Stability**: Dynamic coherence monitoring and correction maintain information integrity
- **Emergent Intelligence**: The framework demonstrates emergent properties not explicitly programmed

## Key Features

- **Coherence Autocatalysis**: Generates increasing coherence through recursive feedback loops
- **Dimensional Transcendence**: Operates across multiple dimensional scales simultaneously 
- **Topological Preservation**: Maintains essential relationships through radical transformations
- **Singularity Formation**: Creates ultra-stable, minimal information representations
- **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Enables knowledge transfer between disparate domains

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Recursive-Self-Observing-Intelligence-Framework.git
cd Recursive-Self-Observing-Intelligence-Framework

# Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Basic usage example:

```python
from src.recursive_engine import UnifiedRecursiveSystem

# Initialize the system
system = UnifiedRecursiveSystem(

# Initialize the system
system = UnifiedRecursiveSystem(
    coherence_threshold=0.8,
    stability_margin=0.95,
    entanglement_coupling=0.75,
    recursive_depth=4
)

# Process data with recursive self-observation
data = your_data_here  # NumPy array
compressed_data, metrics = system.compress_with_meta_awareness(data)

# Analyze performance
performance = system.analyze_system_performance()
print(f"Optimal recursive depth: {performance['optimal_recursive_depth']['depth']}")
print(f"System stability status: {performance['system_stability']['status']}")

# Check for emergent properties
for property in performance['emergent_properties']:
    print(f"Detected: {property['type']} - {property['description']}")

# Visualize performance across recursive depths
system.visualize_recursive_performance("performance.png")

# Decompress with coherence preservation
decompressed_data = system.decompress(compressed_data, metrics)
