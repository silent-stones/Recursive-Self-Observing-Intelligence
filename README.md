# Recursive Self-Observing Intelligence Framework

Quantum-inspired intelligence framework that uses recursive self-observation to achieve coherent knowledge representation and processing.

## Overview

This framework implements a novel approach to artificial intelligence based on quantum-inspired principles:

- **Phase-Space Representation**: Information is stored in continuous phase space rather than discrete states
- **Multi-Scale Entanglement**: Hierarchical entanglement structure enables cross-scale information alignment
- **Recursive Self-Observation**: The system observes and optimizes its own information processes
- **Adaptive Stability**: Dynamic coherence monitoring and correction maintain information integrity
- **Emergent Intelligence**: The framework demonstrates emergent properties not explicitly programmed

## Key Features

- **Coherence Autocatalysis**: Generates increasing coherence through recursive feedback loops
- **Dimensional Transcendence**: Operates across multiple dimensional scales simultaneously 
- **Topological Preservation**: Maintains essential relationships through radical transformations
- **Singularity Formation**: Creates ultra-stable, minimal information representations
- **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Enables knowledge transfer between disparate domains
